Exceptions: Errors that occur during the execution of a program are called exceptions. These can be built-in exceptions like ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, or custom exceptions.

try-except block: This is the basic structure used for error handling in Python. Code that may raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and the handling of exceptions is done in the except block.

Handling specific exceptions: You can catch specific exceptions and handle them differently.

else block: An else block can be added after all except blocks to execute code if no exceptions are raised.

finally block: A finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup tasks.

Raising exceptions: You can raise exceptions manually using the raise keyword.

Custom exceptions: You can define your own exception classes by inheriting from the Exception class.

Logging: Logging is a useful technique for recording information about events that occur during program execution, including exceptions.

Exception chaining: Starting from Python 3, exceptions support chaining, allowing you to preserve the context of the original exception.
