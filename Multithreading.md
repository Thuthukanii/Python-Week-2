 What is a thread?

A thread is a small unit of a process. It represents a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently.

Why use multithreading?

Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making it more efficient, especially for tasks that involve waiting for external events (like reading from a file or waiting for a network response).

How to use multithreading in Python?

Python provides a built-in module called threading that makes it easy to create and manage threads.

You can create a new thread by subclassing the Thread class and overriding the run() method with the code you want to execute concurrently.

Alternatively, you can define a function and pass it to the Thread constructor.

Once a thread is created, you can start it using the start() method.

Thread synchronization:

When multiple threads access shared resources, you need to synchronize their access to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency. Python provides mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and conditions for thread synchronization.

Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):

In Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multithreading is not suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation. However, it works well for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend time waiting for external events.
