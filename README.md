Definition:

A function in Python is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task.
It helps in modularizing code, making it easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.
Syntax:

python
Copy code
def function_name(parameters):
    """docstring"""
    # function body
    return value
Function Components:

Function Name: Identifier for the function.
Parameters (arguments): Inputs to the function (optional).
Docstring: Optional documentation string to describe the function's purpose.
Function Body: Block of code that performs the desired task.
Return Statement: Optional statement to return a value from the function.
Calling a Function:

To execute a function, you simply write its name followed by parentheses containing any necessary arguments.
Arguments:

Functions can take zero or more arguments.
Arguments can be of different types: positional, keyword, default, and variable-length (*args, **kwargs).
Return Values:

A function can return zero or more values using the return statement.
If no return statement is encountered, the function returns None by default.
Scope:

Variables defined inside a function have local scope and are not accessible outside the function.
Variables defined outside a function have global scope and can be accessed within the function using the global keyword.
Docstrings:

Docstrings are optional but recommended for documenting functions.
They describe what the function does and how to use it.
Accessible using the __doc__ attribute of the function.
Lambda Functions:

Also known as anonymous functions or lambda expressions.
Written using the lambda keyword.
Typically used for small, simple operations.
Built-in Functions:

Python provides many built-in functions like print(), len(), range(), etc., for common tasks.
These functions are readily available and do not require defining.
Higher-order Functions:

Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
Useful for abstraction and functional programming paradigms.
Functions are fundamental to Python programming and are essential for writing clear, concise, and maintainable code. They promote code reuse and modular design, making programs more efficient and easier to understand.
